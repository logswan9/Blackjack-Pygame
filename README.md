# Blackjack-Pygame
Blackjack Game I made with pygame


The ui is very bare bones at the moment. I have yet to finish this project and maybe will at a later date. The game runs and will display scores and instructions in the console. After the initial deal (if the player or dealer does not have blackjack), the user can press space to be dealt another card. The dealer will draw no matter what. There is no implementation on staying yet. Whoever busts or gets blackjack first wins. To play again, press down on the keyboard(not space, I haven't changed it yet). The only issue with the game is the logic regarding aces. It works if the player or dealer has just one ace, but if the player or dealer draws another ace, the logic will compute a score that is not correct. I still have to fix that.
